    <h2>The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</h2>
    <b>BY SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE</b>
    
    
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    PART I <br>
<br>
    It is an ancient Mariner, <br>
And he stoppeth one of three. <br>
'By thy long grey beard and glittering eye, <br>
Now wherefore stopp'st thou me? <br>
 <br>
The Bridegroom's doors are opened wide, <br>
And I am next of kin; <br>
The guests are met, the feast is set: <br>
May'st hear the merry din.' <br>
 <br>
He holds him with his skinny hand, <br>
'There was a ship,' quoth he. <br>
'Hold off! unhand me, grey-beard loon!' <br>
Eftsoons his hand dropt he. <br>
 <br>
He holds him with his glittering eyeâ€” <br>
The Wedding-Guest stood still, <br>
And listens like a three years' child: <br>
The Mariner hath his will. <br>
 <br>
The Wedding-Guest sat on a stone: <br>
He cannot choose but hear; <br>
And thus spake on that ancient man, <br>
The bright-eyed Mariner. <br>
 <br>
'The ship was cheered, the harbour cleared, <br>
Merrily did we drop <br>
Below the kirk, below the hill, <br>
Below the lighthouse top. <br>
 <br>
The Sun came up upon the left, <br>
Out of the sea came he! <br>
And he shone bright, and on the right <br>
Went down into the sea. <br>
