        <p>East of Manhattan is Brooklyn, NY (also known as Kings County). For the folks who never leave Manhattan, the borough may seem like a foreign land (and, oh, it is vast). If Brooklyn were its own city, it would be the third-most populous one in the country. However, the area is definitely worth discovering for it is the home of iconic New York attractions like Coney Island, the Brooklyn Bridge and Prospect Park, plus some of the best New York pizza.

        <p>

        <p>Why is the Bronx called the Bronx?</p>

        <p>
            People often wonder why the Bronx, alone of all New York's boroughs, has “the” as part of its name. It's because the borough is named after the Bronx River and the river was named for a man born in far-off Sweden.</p>

        <p>Why is Staten Island called Staten Island?</p>
        <p>
            The use of Staten Island was named by the Dutch when they first came to the island. Staaten Eylandt (literally 'States Island') was named in honor of the Dutch parliament known as the Staten-Generaal. When the English took over Staaten Eylandt was anglicized to Staten Island.</p>
